<h1>Glossary & Calculation Notes</h1>

<h2>WBGT (Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature)</h2>
<p>Composite index of environmental heat stress combining natural wet-bulb temperature (humidity + evaporative potential), black globe temperature (solar and radiant heat), and air temperature. Two standard formulas are used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Outdoors with solar load</strong>: WBGT = 0.7·T<sub>nwb</sub> + 0.2·T<sub>g</sub> + 0.1·T<sub>a</sub></li>
  <li><strong>Indoors or outdoors without solar load</strong>: WBGT = 0.7·T<sub>nwb</sub> + 0.3·T<sub>g</sub></li>
</ul>

<h2>T<sub>nwb</sub> — Natural Wet-Bulb Temperature</h2>
<p>Represents the effect of humidity and airflow on evaporative cooling. On many electronic meters it is derived from humidity and temperature sensors via psychrometric relationships.</p>

<h2>T<sub>g</sub> — Black Globe Temperature</h2>
<p>Temperature of a thermometer inside a matte black globe (standard WBGT globe is 150&nbsp;mm) that responds to radiant heat (e.g., sunlight) and airflow.</p>

<h2>T<sub>a</sub> — Dry-Bulb (Air) Temperature</h2>
<p>Ambient air temperature measured in moving air, shielded from direct solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Heat Index</h2>
<p>An apparent temperature metric combining air temperature and relative humidity; differs conceptually from WBGT and is not directly comparable for work/rest planning.</p>

<h2>TWL (Thermal Work Limit)</h2>
<p>Estimate of the body’s cooling capacity (W/m²) under current conditions; used to guide operational categories such as Unrestricted, Acclimatization, Buffer, and Withdraw.</p>

<h2>Operational Notes (from device guidance)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow 8–15 minutes after changing environments for sensors to stabilize.</li>
  <li>Measure ~1&nbsp;m (~3&nbsp;ft) above ground in the same sun/wind as the people being monitored; point the back of the unit into the wind; tripod/vane improves accuracy.</li>
  <li>Ground surface (grass vs. asphalt) and radiation conditions affect readings—match your team’s setting.</li>
</ul>
